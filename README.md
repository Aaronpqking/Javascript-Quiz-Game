# Javascript-Quiz-Game

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

This is version 2.0 If you peek at the main branch of this repo you'll have clear picture of where this project started. Although it was functional it was buggy and not a great user experience.
Updates include a polished GUI, removal of system alerts, and buttons for answer choices. I challenged m yself to make this mobile first which was an intersting adventure; thus the portrait image.
